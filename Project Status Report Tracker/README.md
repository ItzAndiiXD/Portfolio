# Project Status Report Tracker

## Purpose
- Tracks the RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status across the 5 major KPIs (Scope, Cost, Schedule, Resource, Benefit)
- Identify any Red/Amber projects that need attention to get their status back to Green and on track to completion by ensuring they have a Plan to Green
- Ensuring the metadata is correct and up to date for the highest data quality
- Check that Project Managers have completed their Project Status Report (PSR) for the month and follow up where necessary
- Analyse the commentary in the PSR reports to set up follow-up meetings with Project Managers to gather further insight and context about their commentary to ensure the PMO are across it

### Project Status Report Summary
This is the summary report of the PSRs for the current month, which uses extracted data from the PPM tool. This is used to follow up any Project Managers who haven't updated their PSR and identify any risks, issues and/or milestones that are due all at a glance.

### Project Status Report Analysis
The PSR Analysis Report is used to track the RAG status across the 5 major KPIs. Whenever a project's overall RAG status is Red or Amber, this is then flagged to the PMO team to then analyse the Project Manager's commentary of the corresponding KPI metrics that are Red or Amber and prepare follow-up questions.
The PMO team will then organise a meeting with all the relevant Project Managers to then discuss further and ensure that a plan is in place to bring the RAG status back to Green.
