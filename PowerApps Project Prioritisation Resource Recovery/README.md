# PowerApps Project Prioritisation & Resource Recovery Form

## Purpose
- Prioritise which projects resources should be working on
- Determine whether certain resources should be retained or released after their contract expires
- Analyse the projects that have been identified as either having an Under/Overspend, ensuring they have submitted a treatment plan to rectify the financial situation

### Home Page
This is the portal's landing/home page, where it has been split into 4 quadrants: PIP (for Portfolio Prioritisation), RRF (for Resource Recovery), Under/Overspend (projects with above or below financial spend) and Admin (only for admins). The current view of the home page is an admin's view. The view changes depending on what kind of access level the user has been given.

### Portfolio Resource Submission Form (RRF)
This screen is accessed when the user has clicked on New RRF Form on the home page. On the first screenshot, the user would select a resource name in the top-left part of the screen, which would then auto-populate the smaller fields below it. The data is gathered from multiple sources that are prepared and linked to the app behind the scenes. On the second screenshot, users would then put the relevant commentary for each of the fields. Once that is done, it is submitted in preparation for the Forum, where key stakeholders discuss the best recommendation for the respective resource.
